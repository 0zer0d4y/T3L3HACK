## How It Works

T3L3HACK operates through two main functionalities: **Identity Decryption** and **Environment Analysis**.

### Identity Decryption

On input of a Telegram username, T3L3HACK embarks on an intricate decryption journey, tapping into diverse data sources including public records, leaked data repositories, and behavioral digital footprints. Our refined algorithms process this myriad of data to disclose the actual persona behind a Telegram profile.

### Environment Analysis

Parallel to direct decryption, T3L3HACK conducts a thorough examination of the digital surroundings linked to the targeted Telegram account. This involves collecting environment variables and relaying them to our Cypher Hive, which in turn sheds light on the user's device and network attributes, further fine-tuning the decryption accuracy.
